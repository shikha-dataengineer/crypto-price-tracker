# Real-Time Cryptocurrency Price Tracker ETL Pipeline

## Overview
This project ingests historical cryptocurrency price data into BigQuery for real-time analytics and forecasting.

The dataset contains historical OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) price data for over 50 cryptocurrencies from **May 2013 to October 2022** on a daily basis. Prices are represented in USD. The data is stored in CSV format for fast and efficient loading.

You can find the original dataset on Kaggle here:

## Progress So Far
1. Dataset sourced from Kaggle  
2. GCS bucket created and dataset uploaded via Cloud Shell  
3. BigQuery dataset (`crypto_analytics`) created  

## Next Steps (Automated)
- Loaded CSV data from GCS into BigQuery  
- Run SQL transformations for data cleaning and enrichment  
- Visualize results in Looker Studio 

## How to Run
Run the ETL pipeline with:

```bash
python etl/etl_pipeline.py
